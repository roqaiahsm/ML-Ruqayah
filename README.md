Lab 1 – Git &amp; GitHub for Machine Learning

Hi, my name is Roqayah Mohaimeed.

I am an Artificial Intelligence student at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU). I am interested in Machine Learning and how it can be applied to solve real-world problems and build intelligent systems.

I am looking forward to learning more about Machine Learning and using GitHub to manage projects professionally.
